Help to Save (‘HtS’) is a new government scheme to encourage people on low incomes to build up a “rainy day” fund.

Help to Save will target working families on the lowest incomes to help them build up their savings. The scheme will be
open to 3.5 million adults in receipt of Universal Credit with minimum weekly household earnings equivalent to 16 hours
at the National Living Wage, or those in receipt of Working Tax Credit.

A customer can deposit up to a maximum of £50 per month in the account. It will work by providing a 50% government bonus
on the highest amount saved into a HtS account. The bonus is paid after two years with an option to save for a further
two years, meaning that people can save up to £2,400 and benefit from government bonuses worth up to £1,200. Savers will
be able to use the funds in any way they wish. The published implementation date for this is Q2/2018, but the project
will have a controlled go-live with a pilot population in Q1/2018.
