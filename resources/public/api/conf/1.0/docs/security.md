It is important that the Vendor maintain strict access procedures to the HMRC Developer Hub covering the Live account,
and ideally the Test Sandbox Account as well.  This API is a private/restricted application endpoint and due diligence
needs to be applied to the account access process in order not to expose the shared Server Token secret.

This API contains Fraud Detection measures and is audited by HMRC.  This does not mean that the Vendor is absconded from
the same due-diligence and procedures must be in place upstream of this API to help prevent fraud.
